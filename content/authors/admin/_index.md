I am broadly interested in using life-history theory as a framework to better understand the ecological and the evolutionary drivers of biological diversity between individuals, populations and species. I am currently in the final year of my PhD at the Australian National University, under the supervision of [Loeske Kruuk](https://biology.anu.edu.au/research/groups/kruuk-group-evolutionary-ecology-and-quantitative-genetics#acton-tabs-link--tabs-group_tabs_biology-middle-1). My thesis is focused on the causes and consequences of ageing and senescence in wild populations. 

I've been spoiled with 30 years of detailed life-history and genetic data collected on a wild population of superb fairy-wrens. I am using this dataset to investigate variation in ageing within the population. A (non-exhaustive) list of the questions I'm interesting in exploring using the wrens include:

* How does ageing impact different measures of fitness? 
* What are the roles of both natural and sexual selection in shaping ageing?
* How does the social environment and cooperative breeding impact ageing? 
* Are there transgenerational effects of age?   
* How can we use quantitative genetics to better understand the evolution of ageing?


I was also interested in investigating variation in ageing across species in my thesis. To do this I have taken a meta-analytic approach, synthesizing the effects of early-life environment on senescence rates across wild bird and mammal populations. I wrote an invited blogpost about this study, published in Evolution Letters, [here](https://evolutionletters.wordpress.com/2018/08/16/the-influence-of-the-beginning-of-life-on-the-end-a-silver-spoon-for-senescence/).
