bio: I am broadly interested in using life-history theory to better understand the ecological and the evolutionary drivers of biological diversity between individuals, populations and species. I am currently in the final year of my PhD at the Australian National University, under the supervision of Loeske Kruuk. My dissertation is focused on the ultimate causes and consequences of ageing and senescence in wild populations. I have been absolutely spoiled with 30 years of detailed life-history and genetic data collected on a wild population of superb fairy-wrens. I am using this dataset to investigate variation in ageing within the population. A (non-exhaustive) list of the questions I am interesting in exploring using the wrens include:
How do age-related changes impact fitness-related traits?
What are the relative roles of natural and sexual selection in the evolution of ageing?
How does the social environment and cooperative breeding impact ageing? 
What are the transgenerational effects of age?  
How can we use quantitative genetics to better understand the evolution of ageing?

You can read all about acturial and reproductive ageing patterns in the fairy-wrens in this preprint (LINK). 

I was also interested in investigating variation in ageing across species in my thesis. To do this I have taken a meta-analytic approach, synthesizing the effects of early-life environment on senescence rates across wild bird and mammal populations. You can read our findings in published in Evolution Letters HERE, or read the blogpost I wrote about this paper HERE.
